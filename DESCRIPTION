Description: Square pie charts (a.k.a. waffle charts) can be used
    to communicate parts of a whole for categorical quantities. To emulate the
    percentage view of a pie chart, a 10x10 grid should be used with each square
    representing 1% of the total. Modern uses of waffle charts do not
    necessarily adhere to this rule and can be created with a grid of any
    rectangular shape. Best practices suggest keeping the number of categories
    small, just as should be done when creating pie charts.
